                The qualification period for the 2021 Conference Trips includes
                net issued business produced during a twelve-month period from
                January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. An additional seven
                days will be given at the beginning of January 2021 to tighten
                up loose ends from the end of the year. Net applications and net
                new member count are calculated during this same qualification
                period.

                All qualifiers must be licensed and in good standing with NMB at
                the time of the Conferences to receive any awards. A qualified
                representative who cannot attend a Conference Trip may be paid a
                cash reward, provided that their absence has been approved in
                writing by the Home Office Rules Committee. In addition, the
                cash reward amount will be determined and will be reported on
                your tax form at year-end.

                Issued business includes all business issued during the
                qualifying period minus chargebacks. Eligible annuity business
                includes deposits into a newly issued annuity, originally
                written by that same agent, in its first policy year. Deposits
                made into an in force annuity after its first policy anniversary
                are not credited for Conference Trips. Annuity rollovers must be
                received in the Home Office and applied to the policy by the end
                of the qualification date to be credited. Annualized net first
                year commission levels include first year commissions only on
                Life policies. No renewal or excess Universal Life commissions
                will count for qualification levels. Any chargebacks of first
                year commissions will be subtracted from business issued.
                Annuity commission will count as earned and credited to the
                agent's account. No Corporate Agency (NMB Brokerage) commissions
                will count for any trips. For independent representatives,
                please note that all qualifications for trip levels are
                established on base level net annualized commissions, not actual
                earned commissions.

                Universal Life Join applications count as two applications.
                Increases in base coverage of $10,000 or more (credited to the
                agent) count as an application. Regarding new member
                applications, a new member is a person who was not previously
                insured under a NMB individual or joint policy within the last
                36 months. Both insureds on an Universal Life Joint application
                count as new members, if they both qualify according to the
                above definition.

                A cash bonus is available for Conference Trip qualifiers. A $500
                cash award is presented to those who produce at the Leader
                Level. A $1,000 cash award is rewarded to those who produce at
                the Legend Level. Take note that this cash bonus does not count
                towards trip credit, but is strictly cash only.

                is the bonus subset MDRT trip. MDRT qualifiers will earn the
                Legend Conference Trip as well as the MDRT Annual Conference
                Trip.

                Any travel or food expenses that are not provided by NMB or in
                the trip package, are the responsibility of the qualifier. This
                includes costs related to airport transfers or automobile and
                travel expenses if driving to a Conference Trip from the
                qualifier's home. Souvenirs and gifts are NOT eligible expenses.
                At the conclusion of a trip, costs related to transportation
                home from the trip are likewise the responsibility of the
                qualifier. The qualifier has the responsibility of submitting
                eligible expenses to the Accounting Department at the Home
                Office to offset a portion of the travel allowance (if
                applicable) by July 1, 2021. The excess over approved eligible
                expenses will be subject to income taxes.

                Qualifiers for the Fast Start to 2020 trip can also qualify for
                the End of Summer Push trip. For each trip, a qualifier is able
                to choose from the two hotel choices, which is NOT necessarily
                based on his/her location. Qualifiers' trip choice will NOT be
                restricted to closest proximity, but do keep in mind there may
                be out-of-pocket travel expenses when choosing the further
                location. A qualified representative who chooses not to attend a
                Fast Start Trip will NOT be paid a cash reward as a substitute.
                District managers, district representatives and independent
                representatives are all eligible for both Fast Start Program
                Trips.
